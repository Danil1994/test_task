# SuperBenchmark
SuperBenchmark is a FastAPI application designed to manage and query benchmarking results for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Install

1. Clone repo:
   --Clone with SSH `git clone https://github.com/Danil1994/test_task.git`
   --Clone with HTTPS `git clone git@github.com:Danil1994/test_task.git`
2. Go to your project folder: `path/to/the/proj`.
3. Load your .env file like .env.example.
4. Activate your virtual env.
5. Install requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Project Setup:

* The application includes a DEBUG mode that allows fetching data directly from the test_database.json file, which mimics a database (data storage format is defined as needed).
* The DEBUG mode is configurable through the SUPERBENCHMARK_DEBUG environment variable.
* If DEBUG is set to False, the application will raise an error indicating that the feature is not ready for production.

## Run

1. Run server: `fastapi dev main.py`
2. Go to link `http://127.0.0.1:8000/results/average` in your browser.


Available Endpoints:
* HTTP GET /results/average

	Returns the average performance statistics across all benchmarking results.

* HTTP GET /results/average/{start_time}/{end_time}

	Returns the average performance statistics for benchmarking results within the specified time window.

Benchmarking Data Format:

Each benchmarking result includes the following fields:

* request_id: Unique identifier for the benchmarking request.
* prompt_text: The input prompt text used for the LLM.
* generated_text: The output text generated by the LLM.
* token_count: The number of tokens in the generated text.
* time_to_first_token: The time taken to generate the first token (in milliseconds).
* time_per_output_token: The average time per output token (in milliseconds).
* total_generation_time: The total time to generate the response (in milliseconds).
* timestamp: The timestamp when the benchmarking result was recorded.
